        Cell Class
            char state
                a cell can alive or dead

            -   constructor(char state)
                    set the state of the cell      
            - getState()
            - setState()
        
        CellMatrix Class
            -  constructor  (int  row , int col)
                - create a matrix of Cell of size row*col

            -  setSurrounding(int row, int col)
                    adds the neighors of a given cell into an arrayList

            -  iteration()
                    Iterate trough the matrix
                    get the 8 direct neighors of the current cell
                    the state of this cell for the next iteration is dependent on the state of its neighors
                    
            -  printMat()
                    after each iteration, print the Matrix to the console
